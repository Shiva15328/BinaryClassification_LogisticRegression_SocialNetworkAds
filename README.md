Used Binary classification of Logistic regression algorithm to build the model.
Age and estimated salary to x, Purchase to y.
Score for entire data = 0.6425, score for training data = 0.6218, score for testing data = 0.725.
printed Confusion martrix. Accuracy = 72.5%.
predicted for age = 26, salary = 15000 as Prediction=0 'No purchase'.
